# Gallium Music Player: Codenamed ChaseMusicX ðŸŽ¼

## A material design music player written using Clean Architecture.

The app is heavily under development and contains a lot of bugs. I will be updating issues as I develop them.
The music player is heavily dependent on Android's media framework and will query music provided by MediaStore for now.


## Screenshots: Progress so far -->

This is my progress so far, I am about 50% complete. There are still a ton of features to be added.
I work on this outside of my day job. So my speed on completing it is not very fast.

I am using Dagger2 for dependency injection [I may migrate to Hilt when Hilt is out of Beta] and Kotlin's Coroutines for background execution.

<b>Note</b>: I do not own any of the Album Artwork showcased in the screenshots above. All artwork is owned by their respective artists.

This readme will also be updated as time goes on but feel free to browse my code as well as read through it.
